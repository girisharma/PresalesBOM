Feature: Adding Site to Opportunities
  As a user 
  I want to add Site to Opportunities 
  So that I can view all the opportunities within one project 
  
  Scenario: User Adds First Site to an Opportunity
    Given that I am a user
    When I add the first site to an Opportunity
    Then I should see the Opportunity on the Project Page
    And that Site should also be known as the "A" location
